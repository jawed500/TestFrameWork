## CI and CD pipeline
### API based application testings
---
### Where do we start? 
---
### Setup goals:
1. Dedicated SDET in CI place
2. All product teams on board with CI processes
3. Team ownership not individuals 
4. Repeatable and disposable framework
5. Quality in every stage of the pipeline
---
#### Test Scenario: reliability
![CI Component Test](template/img/CI_Components_Testing.png)
1. A system with 100 components each having 99% reliability, would yield 37% reliable
2. Would you release?  
---
### How do we ensure 100% reliability? 
---
1. Software application with 100% SLA (or close), you absolutely have to ensure reliability at the lowest level.
2. If cannot ensure and measure reliability at lowest level, cannot possible do that system level. 
3. Unit Testing?
